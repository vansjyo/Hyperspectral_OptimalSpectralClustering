## Steps to run the program
- Clone/Download_Zip the repository
- Open MATLAB and connect to the folder **Similarity_Matrices**
- Modify the code for your input hyperspectral image
- Run any of the codes in the folder for computing the similarity/Adjacency matrix.
- Now connect to the folder **Main**
- Modify the imputs accordingly and run the `Sparse_SpectralClustering.m` or `Spectral_Clustering.m`
